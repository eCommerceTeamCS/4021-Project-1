## Part 1: Generating Hypotheses

Based on the analysis conducted in part 1b, I have been able to form some well-informed hypotheses from the visualizations. They are as follows, listed as null and alternative hypotheses and followed by how I arrived at them:

..As for accident severity in regards to **Accident Damage (ACCDMG)**:
*1) H0: Higher train speeds among freight trains have no effect on accident damage*
*Ha: Higher train speeds among freight trains result in higher accident damage*

*2) H0: Accidents caused by Human Factors have no effect on accident damage*
*Ha Accidents caused by Human Factors have an effect on accident damage*

..As for accident severity in regards to **Casualties**: 

*1) H0: Derailment caused accidents do not increase the number of casualties*  
*Ha: Derailment caused accidents do increase the number of casualties* 

*2) H0: Highway-rail crossing accidents are more severe than other types of accidents*
*Ha: Highway-rail crossing accidents are not more severe than other types of accidents*
